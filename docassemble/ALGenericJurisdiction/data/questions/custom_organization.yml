  You may want to create a state-specific package that is shared across
  multiple organizations.
  
  It could include things like your list of courts. This package just combines
  all of the common files into one package for you to quickly see
  what you will modify.
#include:
#  - docassemble.ALMyState:al_mystate.yml

  You will want to upload a new icon to the "static" folder and update the path
  in the "logo" area below, as well as updating each metadata field below.
  
  If you want to use the sample icon, you need to accept the license here:
